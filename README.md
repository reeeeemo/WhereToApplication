# WhereTo? A Toronto-Based Transit Application
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um2OKdyJG3w&feature=youtu.be
#### Description:
If you have ever been in Toronto, you would know that their transit system is quite easy-to-access compared to their American counterparts. However, the one thing that is lacking is a transit application that is accurate, and is user-driven.

That is what WhereTo? aims to be, a user-driven application where users will get rewarded for reporting issues that will go through verification checks, as well as giving information to other riders based on how full the current bus is, etc.

At the moment, the project is quite barebones, but the majority of the backend has been slated. The SQL database and Azure WebJob applications are all setup, and all that needs to be done is the Xamarin.Forms application, which aims to unite Android AND IOS apps in one IDE, to convey all the caluclations and information accurately.

WhereTo? was an idea I had a year ago after moving to Toronto for school, I noticed that the Transit app was one of the best apps, but lacked in the user-driven part, which is what Waze (another app but focused on drivers) had. Combining the two ideas can help users to find new people, have meetups, know what is in the area of the stop / station they are at, or even just find their bus!

The idea was pondered for quite some time, with some research done into what makes a good application, as well as what does most transit apps don't have. The answer was all the same: user-driven data. Of course there would be a verification process since the user could give a variable answer---good or bad. 

This app also aims to promote events happening in Toronto, I run a gaming club at my college that deals with game programmers, developers, and really just anything that has to do with gaming, eSports, or development. The one issue we face is the ability to get information out to a platform where people can see it. That is also what this app aims to be, similar to an event app like MeetUp, having it all in one place where you can see what goes on close to you, or just close to your station you are at would be perfect.

One of the better ideas I have had for this project that I am still pondering, is the ability to have "group links" where many people can join a "party" of people, and see where they all are, similar to how Life360 works. This is a future thought however.

Another idea is more for the corporate side of Toronto. When someone gives you a location, they expect you to find transit yourself. What if they could send you the address and a link to WhereTo? that gives you directions based on where you are, of course the sender would NEVER know where the user lives, just an address to a location similar to Google Maps.

If you've noticed, I have referenced multiple social and transit apps, as I believe that uniting all these apps would make for an easier experience, especially for Toronto. Toronto suffers from a lack of ability to get events out to the people, as most people have to push further beyond what social medias they already have to get information out. This app aims to make the process easer, and personally make my life easier when I want to find transit.

Thank you for listening to my project, and for hosting this course. It was a pleasure taking it and to be honest it was a dream to have the ability to make this project a reality. If you have any questions, inquiries or concerns please send me an email at robbie@oxley.ca

This has been WhereTo?, hopefully seeing a beta-testing future in 2024!
